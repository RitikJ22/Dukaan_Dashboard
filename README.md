# Dukaan Dashboard

Welcome to the Dukaan Dashboard project! This assignment is part of an exciting initiative from Dukaan, a startup that aims to revolutionize the retail space. The CEO of Dukaan posted this assignment on Twitter, and I'm thrilled to contribute to building a dashboard that aligns with the company's vision.

## Project Overview

The Dukaan Dashboard project is developed using React as the primary JavaScript library, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite as the bundler. This technology stack ensures a modern, efficient, and responsive dashboard application.

## Features
